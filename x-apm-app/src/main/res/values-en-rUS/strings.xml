The commonly used APPs do not interfere in any way. Otherwise, they may cause problems in use, waste a lot of time and effort, and even affect their own lives. The effect (except for friends who are willing to take the initiative to solve the problem), so you do not need to use all the features. \n\nThe new version provides some additional minor features for the Play version and donated friends.
